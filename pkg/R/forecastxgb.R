#' Extreme gradient boosting time series forecasting
#' 
#' The \code{forecastxgb} package provides time series modelling and forecasting functions that combine 
#' the machine learning approach of Chen, He and Benesty's \code{xgboost}
#' with the convenient handling of time series and familiar API of Rob Hyndman's \code{forecast}.
#' 
#' It applies to time series the Extreme Gradient Boosting proposed in \emph{Greedy Function Approximation: A 
#' Gradient Boosting Machine, by Jermoe Friedman in 2001} (http://www.jstor.org/stable/2699986).
