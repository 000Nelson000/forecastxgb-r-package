# forecastxgb-r-package
An R package for time series models and forecasts with xgboost compatible with {forecast} S3 classes

Only on GitHub.  Incomplete.  

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ellisp/forecastxgb-r-package/pkg")
```

Seems to overfit rather severely:
```{r}
model <- xgbts(AirPassengers)
fc <- forecast(model, h = 12)
accuracy(fc)
plot(fc)

```
